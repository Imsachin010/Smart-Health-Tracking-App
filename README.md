# Smart-Health-Tracking-App
## Introduction
The convergence of IoT sensors and advanced health monitoring technologies, such as Photoplethysmography (PPG), has ushered in a new era of remote health assessment and fitness tracking. PPG-based IoT sensors provide real-time insights into various health metrics, including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, and stress levels. 
This project presents a novel solution featuring:
1. An IoT-ML enabled platform for self-monitoring of important health vitals.
2. A fitness assessment score derived through a machine learning (ML) algorithm using the health vitals of a person.

By integrating data on various health parameters, including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and sleep patterns, advanced machine learning models analyze this data to predict a fitness score that accurately reflects an individualâ€™s overall health and fitness level.

## Features
- Unified monitoring of major health vitals.
- Fitness assessment score derived from health vitals.
- Integration of IoT hardware for real-time health monitoring.

## Architecture
The IoT hardware collects real-time health vitals, which are processed by the ML models. The ML models, developed in Python, analyze these vitals to compute a fitness score. This score and the vitals data are then displayed in the Android application, providing users with a comprehensive view of their health.

## How to Use
1. **Setup IoT Hardware**: Connect the sensors (MAX30100, DS18B20, MPU6050) to the Arduino UNO.
2. **Run ML Models**: Use the provided Python scripts to run the ML models and compute the fitness score.
3. **Deploy Android App**: Open the project in Android Studio, integrate with Firebase, and deploy the app to your device.
